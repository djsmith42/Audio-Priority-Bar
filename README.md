## Why

Connect a display and your sound can move to its speakers. Undock or power on a
headset, and you pick devices by hand again. Audio Priority Bar keeps a ranked
list for each kind of device and uses the highest one that is connected.

## Features

**Switching**

- Uses your top available headphones first, then speakers, and your top
  microphone
- One click in the panel picks a device by hand; turn automatic switching back
  on to resume
- A device you pick stays when macOS or another app changes it
- A USB headset's input and output are selected together, with per-row
  **Mic only** and **Output only** overrides
- A brief notice below the menu bar icon shows which device automatic
  switching just picked

**Microphone mute**

- Output and microphone rows at the top of the panel: click the round icon
  button to mute, and it turns red while muted. Drag the slider to set the
  level
- Mute the microphone from the right-click menu, or by Option-clicking the
  menu bar icon
- Mute with Option-Shift-M from any app, with no extra permission. Change the
  shortcut in Settings
- Mute from Shortcuts, Raycast, or a Stream Deck with
  [`audioprioritybar://` URLs](#automation)
- The mute follows automatic switching to the next microphone, and quitting
  the app restores it
- A **Microphone muted** reminder appears when an app starts recording while
  you are muted. Click it to hide it until you next record while muted. It
  and the switch notices can each be turned off in Settings

**Device lists**

- Separate ranked lists for Speakers, Headphones, and Microphones, reordered by
  dragging
- Hide a device, keep one visible but never picked automatically, and remember
  disconnected devices
- Output categories taken from what each device reports, in any system language

**Panel and menu bar**

- A panel laid out like the macOS Sound menu, with an icon for every device
- The menu bar icon shows the current output, like AirPods or headphones, and
  optionally the microphone, labeled in and out if you like. It can be
  outlined in Settings to tell it apart from the Sound icon, and can show
  the volume level beside any device icon. Settings previews the icon as you
  change it
- Liquid Glass on macOS 26, VoiceOver support, and keyboard-accessible actions
- Output volume and microphone level by slider or scroll wheel, with mute and
  availability status
- AirPods battery levels on their rows, left and right apart when they
  differ, and the case
- The battery level of a Jabra headset connected through its Link dongle

**Other**

- Jabra Link headset power-off detection, asked of the dongle rather than
  guessed
- Right-click the menu bar icon to mute the microphone, or for Settings, Check
  for Updates, and Quit
- Open at Login
- Automatic updates: new releases install in the background and the app
  restarts itself, with a manual check and an opt-out

## Install

Requires macOS 14 Sonoma or later. Releases are universal for Apple silicon
and Intel Macs.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask camguillory/tap/audio-priority-bar
```

### Direct download

1. Download `AudioPriorityBar.zip` and `AudioPriorityBar.zip.sha256` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/camguillory/Audio-Priority-Bar/releases/latest)
   into the same folder.
2. Verify the archive before unzipping it:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   shasum -a 256 -c AudioPriorityBar.zip.sha256
   ```

3. Move `AudioPriorityBar.app` to `/Applications`.

### First launch

Audio Priority Bar is signed with its own certificate, not an Apple Developer
ID, and it isn't notarized. If macOS blocks the first launch, open
**System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

<details>
<summary>Or remove the quarantine attribute</summary>

Advanced users may instead remove only this app's quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AudioPriorityBar.app
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Build from source</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camguillory/Audio-Priority-Bar.git
cd Audio-Priority-Bar
./build.sh
```

The universal app is written to `dist/AudioPriorityBar.app`, signed with the
release certificate when it is in your keychain and ad-hoc otherwise.
You can also open `AudioPriorityBar.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build with Command-R.
The first build downloads the pinned [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org)
release into `Vendor/` and checks its SHA-256.

For local development, `./build.sh --dev` builds only your machine's
architecture in the Debug configuration, which is much faster, and writes
`dist/AudioPriorityBar-dev.app`, signed the same way.

## Use

Click the icon in the menu bar to open the panel. Your devices are listed by
priority, and the active one is highlighted.

### Automatic and manual switching

- Automatic switching uses the first available headphone, then the first speaker.
- Selecting a device in the panel turns automatic switching off so that
  choice stays active. Turn automatic switching back on to resume
  priority-based selection.
- A device you pick in Control Center or Sound Settings stays until a device
  next connects or disconnects, and automatic switching stays on.
- When macOS or another app changes the device on its own, as AirPods do when
  you put them in, Audio Priority Bar switches back: to your list with
  automatic switching on, or to the device you picked with it off. A device
  you connect still takes over.
- If macOS takes the device again right after a switch back, as AirPods in
  your ears can, Audio Priority Bar leaves it and names it in the panel.
  **Fix in Settings** opens the AirPods settings, where choosing **When Last
  Connected to This Mac** under **Connect to This Mac** stops them switching
  on their own.
- With **Select headset input and output together** enabled, choosing
  either half of a physical USB headset selects the other too.
- With **Mute speakers when headphones disconnect** enabled, the speakers
  start muted when the headphones playing disconnect, are turned off or run
  out of battery.

Speakers, Headphones, and Microphones remain visible in both modes.

### Device controls

- Drag outputs within or between Speakers and Headphones.
- Reorder microphones within Microphones.
- Use each row's actions menu for keyboard-accessible Move Up, Move Down, and
  Move to commands. Right-click a row to open the same menu.
- Hide a device to remove it from Speakers, Headphones, or Microphones, or
  keep it visible while blocking automatic selection with **Never
  Auto-Select**.
- Use **Show hidden and disconnected devices** to manage hidden and
  disconnected remembered devices.
- Forget a disconnected device to remove its saved settings.
- A device with a paired counterpart, like a USB headset's input and output
  halves, shows an override for the current default: **Mic only** or
  **Output only** while **Select headset input and output together** is on,
  or **Use both** while it's off. It appears only when picking it would
  change something.

New HDMI and DisplayPort outputs start hidden; showing one is permanent, and
**Hide new HDMI and DisplayPort outputs** turns this off for future devices.
The active device always stays listed, even when hidden.

### Automation

Three URLs control the microphone mute from Shortcuts, Raycast, a Stream Deck,
or Terminal:

```bash
open "audioprioritybar://toggle-mic-mute"
open "audioprioritybar://mute-mic"
open "audioprioritybar://unmute-mic"
```

In Shortcuts, add an **Open URLs** action with one of them. The app opens if it
isn't running. Any other form of the URL is ignored. The Shortcuts tab in
Settings lists them with a Copy button.

### Jabra Link monitoring

The app asks a Jabra Link dongle directly whether its wireless headset is
powered off, since CoreAudio can't tell, and falls back automatically in
under a second. Right after replugging, it briefly shows the headset as off
while the wireless link re-establishes, which is expected, not a bug.

Link 380 is hardware-verified. Link 390 uses the same detection but is
unverified on hardware
([details](https://github.com/tobi/AudioPriorityBar/pull/32)). An
unrecognised dongle fails open rather than being treated as off.

May prompt for **Input Monitoring** permission. Open at Login may separately
need approval in **System Settings > General > Login Items**, which Settings
opens for you while approval is pending.

<details>
<summary>Upgrading from V1</summary>

V2 imports V1 settings once on first launch (existing V2 values win). The new
bundle identifier may require re-approving Input Monitoring or Open at Login.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Open an issue first for anything
substantial. `main` is the latest release; `develop` is next.

- Work from a fork rather than pushing to this repository.
- Branch from `develop` and open the pull request against `develop`. GitHub
  bases new pull requests on `main`, so switch it before submitting.
- Every pull request runs both XCTest suites and a universal build.
- Releases are tagged and published manually. The release workflow signs
  the update feed with the `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` secret, the Sparkle EdDSA
  key exported with `generate_keys --account app.audioprioritybar -x`.
